# Course-Planner

Create a Spring Boot server which helps students plan their courses. Specifically, it will show students 
when a course has been offered in the past which may help predict when it will be offered in the future.
You will be writing the server which will use a REST interface to support a web-based UI (web UI 
provided to you by the instructor).

The server will read a locally stored CSV input file containing data about course offerings at SFU. It 
will then process the data to organize it into a well structured model. The serverâ€™s controllers will 
provide access to this data via a REST API.
